#while statement as the iterator !!!!
# Take an array of nummers
#square each number
#return a ****new*** array with squared numbers 
# the example section in read me shows us how method is going to work or behave

#while(conditional that is either T or F) iterator is a loop

#while <<<<conditon>>> do
      ###execution code here (what you want the loop to do until while statement ((while<<condition>>do)) returns false

#end


#learn--f-f in terminal will run next failing test stands for fail fast
